# Oahu June and December Weather Comparison

* Data on precipitation and temperature between June and December was collected from 2010 to 2017 from all observed stations on Oahu and the following is my Analysis:

## 1) Over this period of 7 years 1574 precipitation events where recorded and 1700 temperatures were observed  from June. December during the same period had 1405 events recorded for precipitaton and 1517 temperatures observed. June had 183 data points more than December indicating that data from December 2017 data wasn't included in the data base.

## 2) The precipitation data shows a higher mean (0.217) and median (0.03) in December than in June's mean (0.136) and median (0.02).

## 3) For indications on the spread of the data it is observed that December had a higher standard deviation and maximum number for precipitation. December's standard deviation was 0.0541 which is higher than June's at 0.336. The lowest precipitation for both December and June are 0 but December's  maximum was 6.42 and June's is 4.43.

## 4) The temperatures between December and June indicate that June on record has hotter days on average but not by a lot. June showed an average temperature of 74.9 and  December showed 71.0.


# Recomendations based on Analysis

## The lack of December 2017 data causes less reliable data for this month so more recent data could be generated to compare the winter and summer month for precipitation.

## We could make some plots or charts that can provide visuals to easily spot difference in the weather data. A line plot can easily show the difference over time or a histogram can give us a visual of frequency in precipitation and temperature for December and June.

## I recommend collecting data on the other two seasons of Fall and Spring to have better understanding of how the shop would do in these months based on weather.
